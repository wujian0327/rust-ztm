## Description

<Summary/>

<FilterDiagram
  name="print"
  input="Event"
  output="Event"
/>

This filter is different from [dump()](/reference/api/Configuration/dump) in that:

- It only prints out _Data_ events
- It dumps out _Data_ object without formatting, so if the _Data_ is not text, it could mess up your terminal

This filter passes everything down unaltered. It doesn't change anything in the event stream.

## Syntax

``` js
pipy()
  .pipeline()
  .print()
```

## Parameters
