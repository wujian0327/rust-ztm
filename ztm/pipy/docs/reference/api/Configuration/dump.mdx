## Description

<Summary/>

<FilterDiagram
  name="dump"
  input="Event"
  output="Event"
/>

This filter is different from [print()](/reference/api/Configuration/print) in that:

- It prints out all types of events
- It dumps out _Data_ object in two formats side by side: hexadecimal and text

You can attach extra information to print out along with the events by the _tag_ parameter. It can be any truthy value or a function that returns a truthy value.

This filter passes everything down unaltered. It doesn't change anything in the event stream.

## Syntax

``` js
pipy()
  .pipeline()
  .dump()

pipy()
  .pipeline()
  .dump(tag)

pipy()
  .pipeline()
  .dump(() => getTag())
```
