# Keywords

PipyJS has no control flow or OOP constructs, so it does NOT have the following keywords from the standard JavaScript:

## Control flow related keywords

PipyJS does NOT have the following control flow related keywords:

`break` `case` `catch` `continue` `debugger` `default` `do` `else` `finally` `function` `for` `if` `return` `switch` `throw` `try` `while` `with` `yield`

> Although PipyJS doesn't have the keyword `function`, you can define functions by using the arrow operator `=>`. For example:
> ``` js
> (x, y) => Math.sqrt(x * x + y * y)
> ```

## OOP related keywords

PipyJS does NOT have the following OOP related keywords:

`class` `import` `export` `extends` `static` `super`

# Data types

PipyJS uses the same type system as ECMAScript only without BigInt and Symbol:

* There are 4 primitive types:

  - Undefined. The unique value `undefined` when a variable is not initialized yet.
  - Boolean. `true` and `false`.
  - Number. A 64-bit double precision floating number, such as `123`, `0xabc`, `3.1415926`, `1e6`.
  - String. A sequence of Unicode characters.

* plus _Object_, which represents structural data. It can be:

  - Null object, represented by a unique value `null`.
  - A user defined _plain old data_, such as `{ x: 1.2, y: 300 }`
  - A builtin object, such as _Array_ or _RegExp_.
  - A function, such as `(a, b) => a * a + b * b`.

Besides the lack of _BigInt_ and _Symbol_, there are some other differences from ECMAScript as well:

- Strings are stored internally in UTF-8, and accessible to scripts in terms of UTF-32. That means `"ðŸ˜€".length` is 2 in standard JavaScript, while in PipyJS, it's 1.

- PipyJS is JavaScript without OOP, so user-defined classes or constructors are not supported. There's also no prototype system to define user classes by inheritance.

# Operators

PipyJS supports all standard JavaScript operators. Here's a quick recap. For more details, please refer to [Expressions and operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators) on MDN.

## Assignment operators

| Operator | Name |
|:---------|:-----|
| = | Assignment |
| += | Addition assignment |
| -= | Subtraction assignment |
| *= | Multiplication assignment |
| /= | Division assignment |
| %= | Remainder assignment |
| **= | Exponentiation assignment |
| <<= | Left shift assignment |
| >>= | Right shift assignment |
| >>>= | Unsigned right shift assignment |
| &= | Bitwise AND assignment |
| ^= | Bitwise XOR assignment |
| \|= | Bitwise OR assignment |
| &&= | Logical AND assignment |
| \|\|= | Logical OR assignment |
| ??= | Logical nullish assignment |

## Comparison operators

| Operator | Name |
|:---------|:-----|
| == | Equal |
| != | Not equal |
| === | Strict equal |
| !== | Strict not equal |
| > | Greater than |
| >= | Greater than or equal |
| < | Less than |
| <= | Less than or equal |

## Arithmetic operators

| Operator | Name |
|:---------|:-----|
| + | Addition or unary plus |
| - | Subtraction or unary negation |
| * | Multiplication |
| / | Division |
| % | Remainder |
| ++ | Increment |
| -- | Decrement |
| ** | Exponentiation |

## Bitwise operators

| Operator | Name |
|:---------|:-----|
| & | Bitwise AND |
| \| | Bitwise OR |
| ^ | Bitwise XOR |
| ~ | Bitwise NOT |
| << | Left shift |
| >> | Right shift |
| >>> | Unsigned right shift |

## Logical operators

| Operator | Name |
|:---------|:-----|
| && | Logical AND |
| \|\| | Logical OR |
| ! | Logical NOT |

## String operators

| Operator | Name |
|:---------|:-----|
| + | String concatenation |
| += | String concatenation assignment |

## Relational operators

### `a in b`

Returns true if `b` has property `a`.

### `a instanceof b`

Returns true if `a` is of type `b`.

## Conditional (ternary) operator

The conditional operator returns one of two values based on a condition.

``` js
condition ? value1 : value2
```

If `condition` is true, `value1` is returned. Otherwise, `value2` is returned.

## Unary operators

### `delete`

Erases an object's property.

### `typeof`

Retreives a value's type.

### `void`

Always returns `undefined` after evaluating its operand.

## Comma operator

The comma operator `,` evaluates both of its operands and returns the value of the second one. It's particularly useful in PipyJS since PipyJS does not support statements but only expressions. When a sequence of actions need to be taken, we can put them together with the comma operator.

``` js
doActionA(),
doActionB(),
doActionC()
```

That expression is equivalent to the following statements in standard JavaScript:

``` js
doActionA();
doActionB();
return doActionC();
```

# Variables

PipyJS doesn't support statements, so there's no way to declare variables with the `var` or `let` keywords. But that doesn't mean we can't have variables. We will have them in the "_functional_" way.

## Global variables

Global variables in PipyJS are also called "_context variables_". Refer to [Context](/intro/concepts#context) for a deep dive into the concepts of _context_ and _context variables_.

We define global variables in PipyJS by using the builtin function [pipy()](/reference/api/pipy), which is always the very first function you are going to call at the beginning of your script.

``` js
pipy({
  _myGlobalVariable: undefined
})
```

> For convention, we always start **global variable names** with an underscore, though it is not enforced by the language itself.

Global variables are scoped within a single file or [_module_](/intro/concepts#module), and can be shared between different modules by using [export()](/reference/api/Configuration/export) and [import()](/reference/api/Configuration/import).

``` js
// file A
pipy().export('namespace-1', {
  __myGlobalVariable: undefined
})

// file B
pipy().import({
  __myGlobalVariable: 'namespace-1'
})
```

> For convention, we always start **exported global variable names** with double underscores, though it is not enforced by the language itself.

## Local variables

In PipyJS, we use function arguments nested inside a function scope for local variables.

``` js
void ((
  x, y, z, // declare local variables as function arguments
) => (
  x = 0,
  y = 0,
  z = 0 // initialize and use the variables in the function body
))() // Don't miss the () to invoke the function right away!
```

> If the above expression is supposed to be evaluated to some return value that will be used afterwards, you should remove the operator `void` at the beginning.

# Control flow

As said above, PipyJS doesn't support control flow related keywords from the standard JavaScript. But we can still have branches and loops, again, in the "_functional_" way.

## Branch

We can use the logical operator `&&` for simple branches.

``` js
res.status === 200 && (_result = 'OK', console.log('Success.'))

// That's equivalent to:
if (res.status === 200) {
  _result = 'OK';
  console.log('Success.');
}
```

We can combine logical operators `&&` and `||` for multiple-choice branches.

``` js
(res.status === 200) && (
  _result = 'OK'
) ||
(res.status === 404) && (
  _result = 'Not found'
) || (
  _result = ''
)

// That's equivalent to:
if (res.status === 200) {
  _result = 'OK';
} else if (res.status === 404) {
  _result = 'Not found';
} else {
  _result = '';
}
```

## Loop

You can scan an array with [Array.forEach()](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach) for a simple range-loop.

``` js
new Array(100).fill(0).forEach(
  (_, i) => (
    console.log(i)
  )
)

// That's equivalent to:
for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
```

Or, for a generic conditional loop, you can use the builtin function [repeat()](/reference/api/repeat).

``` js
void ((
  n, i
) => (
  n = i = 1,
  repeat(
    () => (
      n *= i,
      i += 1,
      i <= 10
    )
  )
))()

// That's equivalent to:
let n = 1, i = 1;
while (i <= 10) {
  n *= i;
  i += 1;
}
```
